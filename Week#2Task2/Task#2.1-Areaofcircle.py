# Write a Python program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius using the formula area=π×r^2 ( Take pie as 3.14)

pi = 3.142
r = 3
area = pi * r ** 2
print("Area of the circle is:", area)

pi = 3.142
r = float(input("Enter the value of radius: "))
area = pi * r ** 2
print("Area of the Circle is:", area)
