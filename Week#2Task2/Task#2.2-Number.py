# Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

a = int(input("Enter the first number "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number "))
print("both the numbers are equal", a == b)
print("a is greater than b", a > b)
print("b is greater than a", b >a)
#            OR
print(a == b)
print(a > b)
print(a < b)
