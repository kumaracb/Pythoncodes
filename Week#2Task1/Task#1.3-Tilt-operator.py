# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
# The ^ operator will perform the operation of XOR, like whenever both the inputs are true/false
# then result will be "false" and either any one of input is true then result will be "true"

a = int(input("Enter the value 1 "))
b = int(input("Enter the Value 2 "))
c = str(a ^ b )
print(c)
